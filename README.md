# Cplusplus-Program
The purpose of my program is to receive inventory data from a text file, output such data to another file in a desirable format, and allow the user to choose from three analysis styles to view such data involving a search option, numerical representaiton of each item, or tally representation of each item. I did well to compartamentalise various functionality ranging from data processing to output through the use of an inventory class as opposed to lazy main code. However, imporvements could be done to the input section of the program since there is minimal input checking and therefore possibility of annoying outcomes in the event of sloppy input. The most difficult piece of the program at first was getting comfortable with map member manipulation and syntax, but quickly became a breeze to work with after a quick google search leading me to proper syntax and practices. This program was quite easy to keep maintainable and readable due to my early implementation of class methods preventing visual clutter. I feel much more confident in skills pertaining to C++ and overall programming, especially object oriented design and general code structure due to this project.
